# VITHACK_EDUCATE_APP

Our project aims to bring together teachers and students and provide a platform for better connectivity.

The two actors in our system our students and teachers who are going to be selecting their choice of subject which is not restricted to just academics but also to activities like music and dance. A teacher will list down their area of expertise and they’ll accordingly come up in the search results of students. Information about fees and schedule will be provided next to the name and area of expertise of each teacher. Within the app, there’s a chatbox to make discussion among students possible for course related queries or anything they like.

Within this covid pandemic era and the widespread use of online mode to conduct classes, a lot of instances came out where students used fake aliases to join classes and then went on to abuse the teachers either in text or voice. We’re tackling this problem by blocking these offensive words using our model and the person can’t get away with what they do since the login is only from a registered mobile number via an OTP which will make it obvious who the culprit is. It consists of Video call functionality with a special feature of blocking students who are speaking abusive or bad words during a live session. The student will be reported to the admin of the app and all the records of the blocked student will be sent to the admin app. Admin can unblock the student again. 

Another challenges is local tutors from cities and villages face publicity and lack of reach among students, no matter how good they are, just because some tutors are better advertised online. This will not only expand their reach but it helps them explore more than what they already know, given the different sets of domains available. 

The factors for determining whether a teacher can be assigned a student is if a student is registering before the maximum number of students have registered for that course, if that student isn’t committed to that time slot under another course faculty, if that student has paid the fees. 

We don’t want to restrict this app to the pandemic era and we want to leave some close for offline consultancy so the feature of location can give the students an idea about how close a given course instructor is to their homes. Accordingly, they can make a decision because if need be, they might have to visit the instructor for clarification of doubts if the online platform doesn’t suffice. 

We’re implementing this within the Covid pandemic era by using data from the Arogya Setu app to determine the number of cases around a teacher’s location so that a student can visit on their own risk and they’ll be notified whether it is allowed or not, safe or not, to visit the said instructor. 

Once registered, students will be notified about the upcoming classes in their notification page, where they’ll be provided a unique meeting ID for their class. 

We’re providing two more features in the future in our app which we feel is the need of the hour. Number one, nursery students are not getting the same kind of nurturing as they did face to face. Nothing can replace that but to make lives a little better for them, we’re introducing an animation feature where in the teacher will appear like a cartoon which will move in strict accordance with how the teacher is moving, basically giving an idea about a cartoon teaching them interactively. 

Last, which is applicable for all of us, we need to have a proper check for the attentiveness of students because more than 80% students log in to the app, open class, and sleep and only give attendance at the end of the class. To tackle this problem, we propose a speech to text system where the entire lecture given by the teacher will be converted into notes and then our model will automatically prepare questions from that which will be circulated to the class at the end of the session, hence making it strictly important to listen to the class since the teacher’s lecture, not the PPT, not the internet, is where the questions are from. This will encourage students to pay more attention in class and will reduce the headache of the teacher to prepare questions while they should just be moving on to their next class. 

Teachers also complained about the online test procedures, as there is no way a teacher can invigilate students while taking exams as students can open up the book in their home. So, teachers are demanding a way to invigilate students while taking the exam.

Then comes the appointment feature. Before contacting any teacher we have to make an appointment with him/her to ask for their time. So our App includes this cool feature of appointment for the students. This reduces the chaos and brings the working thing so that follows proper protocol.

Teachers wanted an invigilation system to invigilate students during the test. In our App we provided this feature by camera proctored examination feature all with AI monitoring such as mobile detection, eye movements, screen recording, person detection, usb keyboard range detection etc. Under this a teacher can proctor all students through their webcams while the students are giving tests, also the teacher can pass their voice in the whole class to convey messages during tests

The students who are trying to cheat will get flagged during the exam. Also if they try to move out of the screen, the screen will be closed automatically.

Also our app has a feature of assignment submission. The teachers can upload the assignment questions along with the due date and students on the other hand can upload the solutions of these tests on the app itself.
